# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
* [CometChat](https://www.cometchat.com/)
